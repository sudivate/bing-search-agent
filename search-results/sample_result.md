            "text": "Here are the latest developments in AI agents from the past week (mid-July 2025):\n\n- **Major Funding and Startups:** ElevenLabs and Northzone backed the Spanish AI agent startup Murphy, which raised $15 million to build AI-powered debt collectors. There is a surge in funding for AI agent startups across Europe, with several early-stage companies in the Nordics and elsewhere attracting investor attention. Monzo alumni also raised $13 million for AI customer service agents targeting financial services, aiming for US expansion. Meanwhile, Paris-based Nabla recently raised $70 million to build AI agents for doctors【3:3†source】.\n\n- **Business and Technology Trends:** The industry is shifting from simple automation to agentic AI—systems that can perceive, decide, and act autonomously. These agents are now being integrated into business workflows, with the promise of handling complex tasks without human intervention. This new wave is powered by advances in large language models, orchestration tools, and machine learning, enabling AI agents to proactively manage tasks like scheduling, customer service, and even business trip planning【3:2†source】.\n\n- **Regulatory and Industry News:** The European Commission confirmed that the EU AI Act will roll out on schedule, with new obligations for general-purpose AI models starting in August 2025. In the US, the Senate rejected a proposed 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulations, signaling a move toward federal standards. Meta has also made headlines by acquiring ScaleAI for $15 billion, aiming to accelerate the development of autonomous AI agents for business productivity【3:1†source】.\n\n- **Other Notable Developments:** Microsoft’s MAI-DxO AI agent outperformed doctors in diagnosing complex medical cases, and Cloudflare introduced a pay-per-crawl model to control AI data access. There is also growing scrutiny over Google’s AI Overviews feature, with EU publishers filing antitrust complaints about its impact on web traffic and competition【3:0†source】【3:1†source】.\n\nThese stories highlight the rapid evolution of AI agents, their growing business impact, and the regulatory attention they are attracting worldwide."
